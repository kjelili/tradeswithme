# V5.4 Broker execution (Alpaca + Kraken)

The nightly cron (02:20 UTC) now ends with an execution cycle:

```text
settle → train → scan → persist evidence
→ manage open bot positions (stops/targets/time exits)
→ reconcile broker vs ledger
→ decide mode (OFF / PAPER / LIVE)
→ place new protected entries from the overnight plan
→ email alert
```

## Safety model

| Guard | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Default | `EXECUTION_MODE=off` — nothing is sent to any broker. |
| Evidence gate | `live` is honoured **only** when Forward Trust reports `VALIDATED` (≥100 settled calls, expectancy ≥0.2%, PF ≥1.3, max DD ≤10%). Otherwise the bot trades **paper**. |
| Hard cap | Total open bot exposure ≤ `LIVE_HARD_CAP_GBP` (default £50; code ceiling £1,000). |
| Positions | Max 3 open. One per symbol. Whole shares on Alpaca. |
| Broker-held stops | Alpaca: bracket order (GTC take-profit + stop). Kraken: market buy with conditional stop-loss close. Stops work while the app sleeps. |
| Loss breaker | Live entries stop when 30-day realised loss ≥ `LOSS_BREAKER_PCT` of the cap. |
| Kill switches | Owner desk "Halt" (instant, DB) · `TRADING_KILL_SWITCH=on` (env) · "Flatten all" closes everything. |
| Reconciliation | Unknown Alpaca positions block new entries. Unreadable state fails closed. |
| Idempotency | One order per symbol/day/mode (`client_ref` unique). Ambiguous timeouts are reconciled, never resubmitted. |
| Auth | Owner endpoints now fail closed in production if `APP_ACCESS_CODE` is missing. |

Kraken has no spot sandbox: in PAPER mode Kraken orders are sent with `validate=true` (checked, never executed). Alpaca PAPER uses Alpaca's paper account.

## Setup

1. Re-run `supabase/schema.sql` (adds `twm_exec_orders`, `twm_exec_state`).
2. Alpaca: create a **paper** account, add `ALPACA_PAPER_KEY_ID/SECRET`. Apply for live (UK: NINO or UTR) later.
3. Kraken: create an API key with **Query Funds, Query Open/Closed Orders, Create & Modify Orders, Cancel Orders**. **Never enable Withdraw.** Hold USD for USD pairs. Use a sub-account or dedicated account if possible.
4. Optional: `RESEND_API_KEY` + `ALERT_EMAIL` for email alerts.
5. Set `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`. Watch the "Autopilot" panel on `/desk` for a few weeks.
6. Add live keys and set `EXECUTION_MODE=live`. It stays on paper until the evidence gate turns VALIDATED.

## Known limitations (verify before trusting real money)

- Kraken: confirm on the first live order that the conditional stop-loss carries the same `userref` (the bot finds and cancels it by userref). If it does not, you will receive "No stop found" alerts.
- Exit prices for time/target market closes are recorded as the last-price estimate, not the exact fill.
- At a £50 cap most US stocks cost more than one share per slot, so trades will be mostly crypto.
- The bot checks once per day. Stops are broker-side, but targets on Kraken and time exits are only evaluated at 02:20 UTC.
- UK tax: gains are subject to Capital Gains Tax. Keep the ledger export.
